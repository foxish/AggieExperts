============

Abstract: TAMU faculty put their research on those pages, content management system for site admins and faculty.


Issues weâ€™re trying to solve:
* Professors work on understanding major political events.
* No useful way to find a Prof.

Flow of events:
* Professor logs in a creates a profile page.
* Search by keywords - keyword suggestions
* Possibly in future: Journalists ask questions (authenticate how?)

Login:
* Integrate with net-id (university auth) - look at APIs
* Authenticate by email for now (pre-approved list)
* Later on: group login (?)

Main page: 
* A little text about what the site is...
* Search: on full-text/keywords/people names
* photograph + name + department + keyword {rotating carousel} OR photograph + name + recent news citations
* Tree background in the spirit of the website

A Form Page / output:
* Picture - BLOB
* Narrative description of expertise - TEXT
* Paper links - TEXT
* Photographs (?)

Contact info:
* Keywords (supplied separately by the Prof) 6 or 7 keywords
* Further links to others profiles
* Notify people to keep language a certain way to prevent them using too-technical terms.

Site-admin:
* Edit profiles of faculty
* Approval (?)

How many people could there be?
* <= 300-400 in the early stages
* <1000

Infrastructure?
* Professor will check
* Initially not public: aggieexperts.tamu.edu
* Public audience - journalists
* Mobile accessible = not our main concern

Bells and whistles:
* Pick up content from Prof. pages.
* But the content may not be the same.
* Reminder (poke faculty to update their page)
* Recent/trending
* Expandable quote ticker thing
* Scroll to the right link
* Next meeting in two weeks
