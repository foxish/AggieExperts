Feature: Admin Page
As an administrator,
So that I can audit users,
I need to be able to view a full list of users, their email addresses and their status

Scenario: navigation from homepage
  Given I am on the home page
  Then I should see "Home"
  And I should see "Contact Us"
  And I should see "Admin Page"
  When I follow "Admin Page"
  Then I should see "Name"
  And I should see "Email"
  And I should see "Action"
